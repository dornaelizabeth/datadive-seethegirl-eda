# datadive-seethegirl-eda
This notebook is the result of my volunteer work for the DataDive Event hosted by DataKind that happened on 18 September 2021. I conduct data exploration to support the Delores Barr Weaver Policy Center's (DBWPC) mission of championing young women, especially those in the justice system, in Florida.
